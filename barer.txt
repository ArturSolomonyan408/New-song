Work it, make it, do it
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
I need you right now
